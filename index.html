									<h1>Rush Royale Online Generator</h1>
									<p>Specify the exact amount virtual currency ( Gold) that you want to add to your account. Confirm your selection with the press of a "Generate" button.
You will be asked for your username as well as about the operating system that you're playing the game on. This is absolutely necessary since the game is spread across so many different systems. If you want to be able to receive your virtual currency, you will need to tell us exactly what system you're playing on and under what username.
Remember, this is public information that were asking. Your username is known to every player you ever play against. We are not asking you for private information such as your password and we never will!
